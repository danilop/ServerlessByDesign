# Serverless By Design

This is a visual approach to serverless development:

- An application is a network of _nodes_ (serverless resources, such as Lambda functions or S3 buckets) connected by _edges_ (their relationships, for example a trigger or a data flow)
- _Edit_ an application adding nodes and edges following an _event-driven_ design
- _Import_ a previously exported application to continue working on it
- Choose a _runtime_, and _build_ your application (for example, using AWS SAM)
- Edit _templates_ and code files for the final configurations before deploying the application
- _Export_ an application to save it for later use in a JSON file
- Take a _picture_ of the application architecture to have a visual representation to share
- Fine tune the _physics_ used to place nodes and edges on the screen, for example enable/disable it or choose another solver
